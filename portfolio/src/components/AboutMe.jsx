        Hello, it is a pleasure to meet you! I'm a Junior Full Stack Developer
        with a strong foundation in the MERN stack, specializing in backend
        development. I have experience building scalable APIs, managing
        databases, and handling authentication. While my strengths lie in
        backend development, I also have a solid grasp of frontend technologies
        and am continuously improving to become more proficient. Iâ€™m eager to
        expand my skill set, take on new challenges, and contribute to impactful
        projects.
