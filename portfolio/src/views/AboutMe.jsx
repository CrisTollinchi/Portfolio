          Hello, it is a pleasure to meet you! I'm a Junior Full Stack Developer
          with a strong foundation in the MERN stack, specializing in backend
          development. I have experience building scalable APIs, managing
          databases, and handling authentication. While my strengths lie in
          backend development, I also have a solid grasp of frontend technologies
          and am continuously improving to become more proficient. Iâ€™m eager to
          expand my skill set, take on new challenges, and contribute to impactful
          projects.
